        <p>I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, earning a bachelors degree with double majors in
            economics
            and
            history. I later went back to college to get an associate degree in science and another associate degree in
            computer science. I also took prerequisites for a second degree Bachelor of Science in
            Nursing (BSN) and was admitted to a few nursing programs. I was also admitted to a masters program in
            information
            and computer science at the University of Luxembourg in 2017. The German language coursework I completed
            during my undergraduate education helped to open the door to the University of Luxembourg. My interests
            include developing my software engineering/programming skills, technology and healthtech. I would like to
            realize all of these aforementioned educational goals in the near future. I'm a health nut and enjoy
            running outdoors during my freetime as well as traveling and experiencing foreign cultures.</p>
